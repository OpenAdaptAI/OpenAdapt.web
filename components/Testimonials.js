            hours of manual chart review over the course of 6 months to recover. OpenAdapt 
            was able to do this job <b>automatically with just a few clicks</b>. The personalized 
            service and support were phenomenal. I will definitely be using OpenAdapt to audit 
            my procedures every month from now on.<p>`,
