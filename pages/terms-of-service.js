            <h1 className={styles.heading}>Terms of Service</h1>
            <p className={styles.paragraph}>
                By using OpenAdapt, you agree to the following terms and
                conditions:
            </p>

            <h2 className={styles.subheading}>1. Alpha Software</h2>
            <p className={styles.paragraph}>
                OpenAdapt is currently in an alpha stage of development. This
                means that the software is still in an early phase of testing
                and may not be fully optimized for performance, reliability, or
                functionality. As an alpha user, you acknowledge that the
                software may have bugs, issues, or limitations that could impact
                its performance or the quality of the process automation. We
                continuously work to improve OpenAdapt, but we cannot guarantee
                a flawless experience or perfect results during the alpha stage.
            </p>

            <h2 className={styles.subheading}>2. Disclaimer of Warranty</h2>
            <p className={styles.paragraph}>
                OpenAdapt records your screen, keyboard, mouse, and optionally
                microphone inputs, and transforms this data using various
                algorithms to generate prompts and instructions for AI language
                models. OpenAdapt does not take responsibility for the
                performance or quality of the process automation generated by
                the AI models based on these prompts and instructions. The
                accuracy and reliability of the process automation depend on the
                capabilities and limitations of the AI models used, which are
                subject to change and improvement over time.
            </p>

            <h2 className={styles.subheading}>3. Limitation of Liability</h2>
            <p className={styles.paragraph}>
                To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, OpenAdapt.AI
                and MLDSAI Inc. shall not be liable for any direct, indirect,
                incidental, special, consequential, or exemplary damages arising

                limited to damages for loss of profits, goodwill, use, data, or
                other intangible losses.
